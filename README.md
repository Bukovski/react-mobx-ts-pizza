Educational project. Shop for ordering pizza. There is a sorting by category and a method of making pizza.

I found a [YouTube video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0FGkDGJQjJFMRmP7wZ771m1Nx-m2_qXq) in which the author did not complete his project, so I decided to finish it. I implemented the idea of the author of the course and posted it on my GitHub page as a sample for those who want to see a version of a fully working application

All data from the pizza cart will be stored in localStorage. Added error handling, the user will see an error message.
